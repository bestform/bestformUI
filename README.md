bestformUI WoW AddOn
====================

A collection of useful little tools I happen to find handy and which I might as well code myself instead of using third party tools. Because of reasons.

Currently implemented:

* Autosell: Will automatically sell all grey items when visiting a vendor
* Autorepair: Will automatically repair all items when visiting an appropriate vendor
* Suggest sells: Will show suggestions to sell above grey quality items with the corresponding price - this won't be done automatically
* Report: Will report earnings from said actions in the chat window

Credits go to Lars Norberg, the author of Goldpaw's UI addons. His code for autosell was a primary inspiration for my implementation.
